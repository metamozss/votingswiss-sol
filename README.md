# Voting

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

Contract deployed to: https://explorer-evm.testnet.swisstronik.com/tx/0xeb9c4c1c670ee260758f27792fdcb8cded0362c7c3d0e873d0de613743ba9ff8/internal-transactions
